### Lower the number of full nodes in a blockchain

Full nodes refer to blockchain nodes that contain and have 100% of the chain history available online with a complete history intact, true and secure for the whole chain.  In order to control the quantity and quality of the nodes that make up the chain some project restrict participation to only known entities. This is often referred to as a "permissioned" chain.  A few _permissioned_ organizations (or people) are tasked to provide full nodes and deal with all the operational, security, scaling and reliability tasks.  This can be with and without a rewards for doing so.

Non-permissioned nodes can be allowed to alleviate some of the operational workload, but these nodes are not considered to be authoritative for the true chain history. The true chain history is only provided by the (few) permissioned (full) chain nodes. This solution is chosen by protocol implementations to circumvent the problem, by having node operators that commit to put the investment in to have proper node sizing. 

**SWOT analysis**

| *Strengths* |
| :------------| 
| Efficient way of guaranteeing correct, secure and scalable chain operations |

| *Weaknesses* |
| :------------| 
| It steps away from the decentralization benefit a blockchain presents over traditional database solutions. The strength of a blockchain solution is that anyone can opt in to contribute and help to achieve security and safety. By making blockchains permissioned the security and safety is lowered because the full nodes are operated by a set number of organizations and people |
| One node still has the full volume required, which makes running it and managing the issues around very big volumes still relevant. |

| *Opportunities* |
| :------------| 
| Create a governance structure around blockchain technology that is in line with the traditional IT industry and paradigms while still bringing forward the innovation achieved by blockchain technology. |s

| *Threats* |
| :------------| 
| Secure  operations is threated by having a limited, known number of permissioned operators. The form a set of single points of failure for the whole chains operations and security. |
