| Requirement | Achieved? |
| ---- | ---- |
| pruning solution should be able to run *on* node as well as *off* node by using largely the same method and software | Yes |
| the pruning solution should be able to work using the blockchain nodes local storage capacity only and store de-duplicated chain data on these nodes resulting in an over all lower amount of total disk space usage used for all `N` nodes. | Yes |
|the pruning solution uses a trusted storage facility that uses external storage capacity to store de-duplicated chain data and is (possibly) governed by a DAO | Not needed |
| the pruning solution should store the chain data such that it provides a proof of recovery method | TBD |
| the pruning solution should transport data (by network) *off* node in such a way that it cannot be stopped by entities (read ISP's, governments and other legal entities) | Yes |
| the pruning solution should allow node operators to *opt in* and *opt out* of using it. | Yes |
