# Introduction


## Our Team has serious exertise in storage, automation & internet technology

- first data deduplication system in the world for datacenters & backup (acquired by veritas/symantec) (2002)
- first always consistent distributed key value database in the world https://dbdb.io/db/arakoon (2010-2015)
- first proof of blockstake blockchains in the world (was called Rivine, discontinued because of lack of funds)
- first distributed storage system based on forward looking correcting codes (see Amplidata, used by major governments), scales to zetabytes
- probably first and super high performance always consistent disk volume driver on top of Arakoon and Amplidata, we were able to demonstrate 10.000.000 IOPS in 1 rack back in 2013
- first distributed block based storage system on top of Infiniband for ZFS (was done just before we were acquired by SUN microsystems)
- major world records in relation to hosting of very big internet sites (1998-2000) with global loadbalancing and caching at a time this was not done yet

> We are delighted to use this expertise for the benefit of the world and are grateful for the chance devxdao gives us to develop and contribute even more.


## Milestone 1 (100% done) = 250k USD

- Milestone title:  Create the ability to run layer-1 blockchain nodes on the ThreeFold Technology grid.

- The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 
    - USD 250.000 (was $100k originally)
- Due date: 
    - done
- Details of what will be delivered:
    - prove Layer-1 blockchain provisioning can be done (this is a massive achievement and has incredible benefits for the industry)
    - Initial research will be done with the Casper Labs Layer-1 protocol and also some other blockchains.
    - Create the solution which allows everyone to verify provisioning can be done.

> remarks: we were an early grant and were trying to get feedback before submitting because there was no clarity for us how to do it and how sure we would be on the grant. We might have been not good enough in our communication, but the grant got removed before we could receive funding for the work done. We hope that this might be recovered, as such we have updated this document to reflect our current situation and work done.

### Acceptance Criteria:

> we hope that the reader can see how this work has an incredible potential for the blockchain industry. We have been able to show how blockchains can be deployed on a decentralized grid and helps to achieve reliability, security, privacy and scalability.

- [X] provisioning solution can deploy blockchain nodes and this can be done by everyone
- [X] see how the provisioning method (1-click) cuts heavily on complexity
- [X] deploy a large blockchain in less than 5mins which would have taken hours before (software deployment)
- [X] all required code to allow everyone to experiment (see weblets repository [here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/grid_weblets))
- [ ] agree which blockchain node type
- [X] all code is opensource (threefold as well as the deployers for provisioning)
- [X] do detailed research about casperlabs to see how integration can be done (and if): our conclusion it can be done (and is done)
- [X] link to required technology parts as provided by ThreeFold, see if we can use those solutions and what benefit would be
- [X] do all required work to let it work on ThreeFold Grid

## Milestone 2 (ready to be executed) = 250k USD

Extend the TFGrid with capacity for all current layer-1 protocols involved in ETA, specifically for CasperLabs

- Milestone title:  Extend the TFGrid with capacity for all current layer-1 protocols involved in ETA
- The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 
    - USD 250.000 (was $400k original)
- Due date: 
    - December 2022
- Details of what will be delivered:
    - base on ETA (CasperLabs) input, design capacity size and geographic location and distribution requirement
    - agree with CasperLabs which POC/Operational partners are to be included in this capacity 
  
> Change to this original milestone is that we will do a train the trainer program with CasperLabs or partners companies to make them self sufficient in taking the 1-click solution forward by themselves and make this work for many different type of blockchain nodes.

### Acceptance Criteria:

We have been able to leverage a lot of technology from Threefold Tech which has been developed over the last 10 years. This grant was all about making sure and improving this codebase so it can be used for CasperLabs. This is the result of hundreds of man-months for which we are delighted to receive some recognition in a form of a grant.

- [ ] based on CasperLabs input to where and for what partners private capacity is required, all required capacity has been deployed and is operational
- [ ] CasperLabs and Partner / Customer base has proven to be able to use the capacity and deploy blockchain nodes where required.
- [ ] Train the trainer program done
- [ ] better description of / manuals for the solution
- [ ] documentation and make demonstration tutorials in text and video
- [ ] document all links to code & scripts as used on above
