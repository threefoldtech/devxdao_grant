### Compress data

This is probably the most used method to solve the issue. All participating archival nodes compress the blocks created to minimize the data storage footprint. There are many compression algorithms available and depending on the specific type of blockchain hardware certain algorithms present better options than others.

**SWOT analysis**

| *Strengths* |
| :------------| 
| Simple to implement, plenty of compression algorithms available |

| *Weaknesses* |
| :------------| 
| it does not solve the issue, it postpones the issue becoming a problem.|

| *Opportunities* |
| :------------| 
| Quick to implement, quick to deploy.|

| *Threats* |
| :------------| 
| The storage problem will sooner or later appear. Choosing this solution will allow you to go to market quickly but then you have to hope that a solution will present itself before the issue will become a problem.
