### Erasure encoding for blockchains

The question of applying erasure encoding to blockchain data in order to reduce the storage requirements of individual nodes has been explored in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00860.pdf). The authors conclude that such an approach can provide strong assurance of data correctness without large computational overhead.
