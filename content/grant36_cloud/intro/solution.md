## Solution

ThreeFold is creating technology that creates a decentralized grid with compute and storage capabilities to build a new internet that is not in the hands of a few monopolies but in the hands of many. This stack is centered around a solid "layer-0" which works in a very different way than traditional clouds.

We will identify that this technology is well positioned to create a decentralized platform with smart contract deployment methods that can automate 99% of the work needed for blockchain node deployments.  

This overcomes the 2 problems identified with the current solutions:
- this ThreeFold grid, an internet of internets, is owned by many individuals, companies and governments and presents a true decentralized platform to run blockchain nodes.
- the knowledge required to do such a deployment does not surpass knowledge needed to maintain a digital currency wallet.  And even that can be avoided.

This technology based will be used to create a distributed and decentralized cloud platform where blockchain nodes can run from home, school, office and datacenter locations.  A true step forward in make blockchains resilient.
