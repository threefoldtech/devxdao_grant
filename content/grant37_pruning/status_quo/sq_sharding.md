The practice of splitting a blockchain into multiple segments is known as sharding. This feature is planned for Ethereum 2.0 and is already live on the Zilliqa network. Sharding is presented as an emerging solution to the blockchain trilemma.

| *Strengths* |
| :------------ | 
| Reduces both the storage and computational load of nodes securing each shard, thus improving scalability and decentralization. Could provide better security than multichain ecosystems which appear to have a similar structure. |

| *Weaknesses* |
| :------------ | 
| Sharding is still an experimental technology with limited testing. Adding sharding to an existing blockchain requires significant changes to the protocol itself. |


| *Opportunities* |
| :------------ | 
| If successful, sharding can be a powerful feature and may find wide adoption among blockchains. Node operators on these chains still stand to benefit from distributed archiving of their shard. | 

| *Threats* |
| :-----------|
| This is a complex addition to a protocol that comes with certain tradeoffs and adds additional attack surface. |
