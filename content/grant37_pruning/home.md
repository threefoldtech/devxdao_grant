## The solution

If successful the project will bring new scaling opportunity for level-1 protocols to execute value transactions and smart contracts. 

The current technology reality is that level-1 blockchains will carry forever it's history which will put an increasing demand on storage requirements for all participating nodes. This is not very sustainable and efficients. 

The number of implementations of DAO's is going to be exponentially growing and there is a need for level-1 blockchain protocols to be able to deal with the increased volume of transactions and history where pruning is going to be needed.
