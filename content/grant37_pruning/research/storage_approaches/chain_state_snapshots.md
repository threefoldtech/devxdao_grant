## Chain state snapshots

In addition to archiving the chain itself, verifiable archives of the ledger could provide an expedited way to restore node functionality or bootstrap new nodes.

Work has been done within the Bitcoin community around enabling backups of the chain state database. 

See this [discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8037) on considerations for such an approach and [code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606) produced to implement it.
