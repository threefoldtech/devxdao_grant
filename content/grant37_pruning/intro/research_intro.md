# Intro

This research document represents the first milestone in the grant that has been awarded by DEVxDAO. This document will lay out the challenges that need to be overcome to create a lasting generic solution for the blockchain forever growing data storage problem and then identifies solution paths to this challenge. This document will present a number of solution paths to be looked at and then, as a conclusion, a small numbers of solution paths will be selected for implementation in milestone 2 of this grant.  This documenent is not intended to provides the solutions themselves, more time and proper research and development in the POC phase is required.

Extensive research has been done by a group called ThreeFold into creating a decentralized technology with compute and storage capabilities to build a new internet that is not in the hands of a few monopolies. This research is centered around a solid "layer-0" software stack and we intend to put it to work in conjunction with new innovation to find a decentralized autonomous solution to the blockchain pruning problem.

This research document will look at publications and literature to see what history has taught us how to deal with growing datasets and increasing importance of digital data. Areas that will be investigated are the well known area of backups (full and incremental) and archiving. Another area which might get us some insights is de-duplication of data before it is archived or backed up. Also, we will look at other publications describing research or projects about finding a (partial) solution to the pruning challenge.

After reviewing what has been developed, implemented and proposed as solutions, we will present a number of methods by which we believe we can get to an acceptable pruning solution. We will present SWOT analyses on the methods presented and select the few that are most feasible to get to the required result.

The selected methods will then be architected to a level where we can see how this would work in a real life situation and what is required to achieve this. Recommendations for the second milestone will be presented and risks and limitations will be cited.  
The conclusion of this document will act as a starting point for milestone 2 work.
