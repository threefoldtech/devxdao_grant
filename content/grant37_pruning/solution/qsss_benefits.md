#  Quantum Safe Storage System Benefits

ThreeFold would start from our existin QSSS (Quantym Safe Storage System) to deliver what Casper Labs requires, we would use and extend our existing codebase.

QSFS stands for Quantum-Safe File System. It is a redundant storage system, which can store petabytes of information.

Unique features are : 
- Unlimited scalable (many petabytes)
- Data is spread over many devices owned by different, independent hardware owners called farmers. Together, these farmers provide the capacity to a hardware grid, call the ThreeFold Grid. 
- Dispersion over multiple sites ensures 100% privacy of the data, as no farmer knows what the data is about (zero knowledge storage system). Even a quantum computer cannot decrypt the data on a node, as one node contains insufficient information to unambiguously recreate the authentic data.
- Data can’t be lost: there is a protection for datarot, data will auto-repair.
- Data is append-only and immutable by design of the protocol, so it’s fit for storing ledger history. Even with sites going down, data is not lost with ‘operational’ backup nodes in place.
- Up to 10x more efficient than storing on classic storage cloud systems. Overhead of about 20% is sufficient to have a secure archive.
- Self-healing: when node or disk lost, storage system can get back to original redundancy level.
- Helps with compliance to privacy regulations like GDPR (as the hosting facility has no view on what is stored, information is encrypted and incomplete).
- Hybrid : can be installed onsite, public, private, ...
- Read-write caching on encoding node (the front end).
