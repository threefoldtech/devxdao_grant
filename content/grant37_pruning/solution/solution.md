# Suggestion Solution

Implementing good enough pruning for Casper Labs is not a trivial task.

We believe that we have to put it in 2 phases, 1 phase is for research and proof of concept which can be used generically and proves the concept of a global pruning layer.

The 2nd phase should be for another grant of other collaboration effort to put it inside the storage engine of Casper Blockchain and work closely together with the engineers of Casperlabs.

## Phase 1 Solution

- we want to create a multi tier backend storage system specifically made for blockchains.
- 
We want to create a storage engine which can store 

### Proof Points

- create a global accesible data lake for a blockchain which is deployed in 100 locations and overhead is only 50%. Ea
- prove that 100 MB/sec can be achieved
