## DEVxDAO GRANT Proposal #36


ThreeFold tech applied for grants with the [DEVxDAO](https://www.devxdao.com/) organisation, received approval, and contracts have been signed. There are two grants in total. This repo deals with the research and POC work with regards to grant #36. See also [grant #37](https://github.com/threefoldtech/grant37).

## Efficient operations of a Layer-1 Node on a decentralized cloud
Layer-1 protocols face a major dilemma that is hard to solve:  either run there nodes in hyperscale datacenters whic provide all the knowledge and capabilities to keep a cloud up and running but lead to a centralised install base of relay on IT Sacy community memmbers that can run the nodes on bare metal outside of the hyperscale cloud providers.  The two options provide a solid foundation to run the layer-1 nodes on but lead to centralissation.  For example AWS as a hypersacaler has made onboarding of ethereums nodes very simple and therefore a. high percentage of the etherum nodes live inside AWS datacenters (https://thenextweb.com/news/ethereum-nodes-cloud-services-amazon-web-services-blockchain-hosted-decentralization).

This is not what layer-1 protocols are about.  They are predominantly about decentralising applications, services, transactions, storage and networking.  To do this on a centralised platform as a way to do it, but we believe that there should eb a healthy balance between relying on hyperscalers, system administrators that can do it decentralised and than a third option which is "easy, one-click deployment method" for anyone that wants to contribute to the project on a decentralised and distributed grid of compute and storage capacity.

ThreeFold have been building such a grid of "data processing and storage" generators for the past decade and is currently in beta operational stage.  
These data generators (3nodes) are autonomous and very safe and secure. 3nodes can exists everywhere where there is electricity and network connectivity.  They do not provide access or interfaces for people, both physical and access over the network. Instead of getting “instructions” what to do by a command and control infrastructure they use a distributed ledger (blockchain) to learn what needs to be started or stopped . The 3nodes will start and stop applications (containerized) based on what “workloads” are described in this operational blockchain by smart contracts. No administrator, person, owner can make this 3nodes do anything else than what is written in these smart contracts.

The is the results of years of hard work and as stated before this is now operational (beta) and has a dev, test and mainnet.  Mainnet has about 43000 cores, 7PB of SSD and 32 PB of spinning disks online (global) and is growing fast.  For more information please see here: https://explorerv3.grid.tf/.  The current growth strategy for the grid is to build community clouds.  Community clouds are 3node that are integrated in real-estate developments, in green enery projects (solar and wind) and anything real estate where power and network are available.  The first proofpoint of this happening is a project being bilt in Dubai: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paradise-hills-property-development-threefold-150000884.html.  The working assumption here is there will be a fast growing amount of community clouds developed and available over the coming months and years and therefore it can be a valuable addition to the Casperlabs node footprint.

This grant proposal wants to make all of this technology available to the Casperlabs community and help it to prospher and excel in a number of different ways.
1. Enhance the footprint of CasperLabs nodes the ability to deploy nodes outside of hyperscaler datacenters and inside communities of people optimising network access and cost
2. Enhance the carbon footprint of the CasperLabs nodes by using energy efficient 3nodes and built in carbon offsets
3. Enable people in developing countries to partake in this project and allows them to build local smart contracting solution to prospher their local economy and become less dependent on the rest of the world.

This can all be done with the technology as it stands today and it s good proofpoint / first milestone to achieve. The bigger benefit is something that  needs to be developped but has already a substantial number of building block ready to go.  The ultimate goal of this grant proposal is to create and bild a blockchain pruning mechanism that allows the blockchain to grow forever and have cost efficient nodes everywhere securing operations of the layer 1 protocol

## Explanation 
### Benefit: 
DEVxDAO ecosystem will benefit from grant proposal results  because it will create distributed, decentralised data processing and storage capabilities.  *outside* of market leading hyperscalers.  There simply is no alternative today that offer the same scalability, security, compatibility with industry leading technology stacks (infrastructure as code like terraform etc).  It also combines people to participate in the production of cloud capacity everywhere creating a solid base for local economous to built innovation and solutions on.

It stimulates the community on the following aspects:
- Equal rights for everyone
- Digital inclusion
- Access to education & information
- Only 1 digital identity / own your data
- Infinite experiences
- no abuse = ‘stop being a product’ good for the planet
- Lower carbon emissions
- Enables a global conscious ecosystem
- The internet by itself up to 10x less energy usage

It's a solid foundation for innovation and present the opportunity to solve one of the largest problems in the current blockchain landscape (data

## Milestone #1
### Milestone title: Create the ability to run layer-1 blockchain nodes on the grid.
The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 10000
### Due date: now
### Details of what will be delivered:
The 1-click blockchain (Casper Labs and / or others) node deployment solution - powered by ThreeFold's P2P cloud, using Terraform and/or Docker.  The 
ThreeFold grid has been up and running since 2018 and has a large quantity of compute and storage resources.  The TF Grid is owned by independent farmers 
that believe in decentralized capacity generation everywhere.
Over the last year, a number of blockchain projects have been looking for easy deployment options to allow their communities to have an alternative to "run a node on centralised clouds" to do it all yourself. We can offer a super exciting way here on top of our TFGrid.
### Acceptance Criteria:
All agreed layer 1 blockchain technologies have a "single click" deployment mechanism.  All the current members of the ETA are considered to be candidates 
for grid deployments.
## Milestone #2
### Milestone title: R&D for a whitepaper on blockchain pruning possiblities for the CasperLabs layer-1 blockchain.
The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 50000
### Due date: July 2022
### Details of what will be delivered:

### Acceptance Criteria:
Operational plaform and layer-1 protocols deployed

## Milestone #3
### Milestone title: Blockchain pruning mechanism for the CasperLabs layer-1 blockchain.
The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 190000
### Due date: December 2022
### Details of what will be delivered:

### Acceptance Criteria:
Operational plaform and layer-1 protocols deployed
