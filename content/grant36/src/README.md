## DEVxDAO GRANT Proposal #36

ThreeFold tech has applied for a grant with the dexvdao organisationL https://www.devxdao.com/ and received approval and contracts have been signed. There are two grants in total. This repo deals wit the research and POC work with regards to grant #37

## Decentralized data processing and storage fabric 
Data is the new gold.  Data is generated everywhere but data storage is still very centralized.  Most data lakes exist in one of the main cloud providers and 
while these data lakes grow in size they become increasingly more difficult to move around.  In order for decentralisation to prosper data generated and used 
by DOA projects cannot end up being stored in one of these large cloud providers.
Integration between a layer 1 blockchain project and a decentralised data processing and storage technology will set the blockchain free of running in and 
storing data on these large cloud providers....

## Explanation 
### Benefit: 
DEVxDAO ecosystem will benefit from this integration because the proposed project will create distributed, decentralised data processing and storage 
capabilities following exactly what a DAO is all about: "an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by 
the organization members and not influenced by a central government". Building a DEVxDAO ecosystem needs to have an independent, autonomous platform 
that underwrites the core principles of decentralisation.  The proposed project will exactly build that for DEVxDAO that are here and now and in the future.  It 
can be the underlying platform for layer 1 protocols and end user applications and smart contracts.
This project will create and present a strong foundation for the DEVxDAO community

## Milestone #1
### Milestone title: Create the ability to run layer-1 blockchain nodes on the ThreeFold Technology grid.
The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 100000
### Due date:
### Details of what will be delivered:
The 1-click blockchain (Casper Labs and / or otherS) node deployment solution - powered by ThreeFold's P2P cloud, using Kubernetes and/or Docker.  The 
ThreeFold grid has been up and running since 2018 and has a large quantity of compute and storage resources.  The TF Grid is owned by independent farmers 
that believe in decentralized capacity generation everywhere.
Over the last year, a number of blockchain projects have been looking for easy deployment options to allow their communities to have an alternative to "run a 
node on centralised clouds" to do it all yourself. We can offer a super exciting way here on top of our TFGrid.
### Acceptance Criteria:
All agreed layer 1 blockchain technologies have a "single click" deployment mechanism.  All the current members of the ETA are considered to be candidates 
for grid deployments.
## Milestone #2
### Milestone title: Extend the TFGrid with capacity for all current layer-1 protocols involved in ETA
The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 400000
### Due date:
### Details of what will be delivered:
Extension of the TF Grid to have capacity for data processing and storage capabilities.  Tested and verified hardware platforms are the Scaleout compute, 
Scaleout storage, and Titan V2.  An architecture of how to combine these platforms into a scalable, secure, autonomous, distributed and decentralized platform 
needs to be created and this will also indicate the distribution and deployment plan.
So the deliverable in this milestone is capacity in locations well connected and well powered, available to DevxDAO's  done the DAO way.
### Acceptance Criteria:
Operational plaform and layer-1 protocols deployed
